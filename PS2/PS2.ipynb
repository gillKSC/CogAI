You can assume that the average size of leafbugs in a colony (i.e., $\\theta$s) can be modeled as coming from a Gamma distribution, $Gamma(\\alpha, scale=2)$, shared across the three colonies. Furthermore, you can assume a prior over the `shape` parameter of the Gamma distribution, denoted $\\alpha$, to be a uniform over the range of 1.0 to 15.0. (We assume that we know the scale parameter of the Gamma distribution `scale=2`).\n",

    "The iron core of our planet conducts electricity, which creates a magnetic field around Earth. This magnetic field not only provides a protective shield against sun’s unwanted rays, but also creates a kind of a map that remains relatively constant across time. Many animal species are thought to rely on this magnetic field for wayfinding, from migratory birds across the open skies to fish, reptiles and crustaceans in the deep ocean. For example, sea turtles can use the magnetic field to make plans between points A and B on the globe, and to orient themselves, i.e., to know where they are on the Earth. \n",
